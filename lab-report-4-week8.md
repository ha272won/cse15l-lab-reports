## Decide on what it should produce (i.e., expected output) by using either VScode preview or the CommonMark demo site

## Showing the code in MarkdownParseTest.java for how you turned it into a test

## For your implementation, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.


## For the implementation you reviewed in Week 7, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.

## Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

## Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

## Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
