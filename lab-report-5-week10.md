## How you found the tests with different results (Did you use vimdiff on the results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you use some other programmatic idea?)

## Provide a link to the test-file with different-results (in the provided repository or
your repository , either is fine)

## Describe which implementation is correct, or neither if both give the wrong output
## Indicate both actual outputs (provide screenshots) and also what the expected output is (list the links that are expected in the output).

## Decide on what it should produce (i.e., expected output) by using either VScode preview or the CommonMark demo site.

## For the implementation that’s not correct (or choose one if both are incorrect), describe the bug (the problem in the code) in about 2-3 sentences. You don’t have to provide a fix, but you should be specific about what is wrong with the program, and show the code that should be fixed (Provide a screenshot of code and highlight where the change needs to be made).
