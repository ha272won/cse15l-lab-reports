## How you found the tests with different results?

Modify the bash script as below:

run `bash script.sh > results.txt` after compiling the MarkdownParser.java. This allows to save the result file in the repository. Also, do the same for my markdownparse repository. Then, comeback to the main and run `diff` command to compare two txt file.

## Provide a link to the test-file with different-results
[test-file 487](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/487.md)
[test-file 504](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/504.md)

## Describe which implementation is correct, or neither if both give the wrong output

For both #487 and #504, the provided repository gives the right output. 

#487 : It shows that my code does not check the characters between parentheses that manage the link. In the case of #407, the special character: / is inserted, but this special character cannot be filtered out and are exposed in my code.

#504 : Same as #487, my code cannot check special character. When #487 has a problem because it cannot detect '/', for #504, it cannot detect other characters too: '""', '''', '()'. 

## Indicate both actual outputs (provide screenshots) and also what the expected output is (list the links that are expected in the output).

For #487 : we expect
For #504 : we expect

## Decide on what it should produce (i.e., expected output) by using either VScode preview or the CommonMark demo site.

## For the implementation thatâ€™s not correct (or choose one if both are incorrect), describe the bug (the problem in the code) in about 2-3 sentences. 

My MarkdownParser.java is like below:

For both #483 and #504, to correct this, the code in the if statement must be modified. Instead of directly adding a substring to a variable to be returned within an if statement, we can fix the code in #487 if we add a condition to the temporary variable to store the substring for further verification
