## Provide a link to the test-file with different-results
[test-file 487](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/487.md)
[test-file 504](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/504.md)

## Describe which implementation is correct, or neither if both give the wrong output

For both #487 and #504, the provided repository gives the right output. 

#487 :

#504 :

## Indicate both actual outputs (provide screenshots) and also what the expected output is (list the links that are expected in the output).
Test-file #487
provided repository

my repository


Test-file #504

For #487 : we expect
For #504 : we expect

## Decide on what it should produce (i.e., expected output) by using either VScode preview or the CommonMark demo site.

## For the implementation that’s not correct (or choose one if both are incorrect), describe the bug (the problem in the code) in about 2-3 sentences. You don’t have to provide a fix, but you should be specific about what is wrong with the program, and show the code that should be fixed (Provide a screenshot of code and highlight where the change needs to be made).
